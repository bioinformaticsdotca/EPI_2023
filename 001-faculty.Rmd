>Professor, McGill University <br>
Director of Bioinformatics, Genome Quebec Innovation Centre <br>
Director, Canadian Centre of Computational Genomics <br>
Director, McGill initiative for Computational Medicine <br>
>

Dr. Bourque research interests are in comparative and functional
genomics with a special emphasis on applications of next-generation sequencing technologies.
His lab develops advanced tools and scalable computational infrastructure to enable large-scale
applied research projects.

#### Martin Hirst

Dr. Hirst’s research focuses on understanding epigenetic dysfunction in
cancer and his laboratory develops experimental and computational tools to characterize normal
and transformed cell types down to the single cell level. He applies these tools to explore the
epigenomic states of normal and transformed cell types to discover and exploit therapeutic
vulnerabilities.

#### David Bujold

>Bioinformatics Manager, Data Unit <br>
Canadian Centre of Computational Genomics
>

He joined the McGill Epigenomic Data Coordination Center at McGill in
2012 to tackle challenges related to epigenomics, and has since developed
many data management and discovery solutions, including the IHEC Data Portal. Other projects
of interest include CanDIG and EpiShare, platforms to make genomic and epigenomic data
under controlled access more accessible, while maintaining study participants’ privacy.

#### Jose Hector Galvez

As a Bioinformatics Analyst in the TechDev team, Mareike is responsible
for maintaining pipelines in GenPipes, testing and developing new pipelines
for the community, and responding to user requests. Prior to joining C3G,
she worked as both a field and computational biologist, with her doctoral and postdoctoral
research focusing on mammalian comparative genomics, phylogenomics, and metagenomics,
most often in primates.

#### Michelle Brazas
